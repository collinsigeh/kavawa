Like other Laravel applications, the configurations needed could be done on the .env file.

The next step would be to run your database migrations.

Addtionally, there's an in-built setup that needs to be implemented. Simply click on the "run setup" link that will
be displayed on the home page if you're not setup and you'll be good to go.
